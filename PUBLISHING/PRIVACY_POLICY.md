**Effective Date: January 31, 2026**

Aura Editor ("we," "our," or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.

### 1. Information Collection and Use
**Aura Editor does not collect or store any personal data on our own servers.** 

*   **Local Storage:** All documents, titles, and editor content are stored locally on your device using browser-based storage (LocalStorage). This data never leaves your device unless you choose to share or export it.
*   **AI Interactions:** When you use the "AI Refine" or "AI Assistant" features, the text you provide is sent to the **Google Gemini API** to process your request. This data is handled according to Google's AI Privacy Policy. We do not store these conversations permanently.

### 2. Permissions
The App may request minimal permissions required for basic functionality:
*   **Internet Access:** Required solely to communicate with the Gemini AI engine for content generation and refinement.
*   **Storage Access:** Required to download and save your documents as text files to your device.

### 3. Third-Party Services
We use Google Gemini AI as a third-party service provider. By using the AI features, you acknowledge that your input will be processed by Google. We recommend reviewing [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for more details.

### 4. Data Security
We prioritize the security of your local data. Since your work is stored on your device, its security depends on your device's security settings. 

### 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in this document or within the App.
